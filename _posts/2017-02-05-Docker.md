This post will be about Docker and aims to be a basic introduction to the topic. 

## What is Docker?

Docker is a technology that enables you to take an entire application and its dependencies and package it up into a read-only image using the tools installed together with Docker. This image can then be used a number of times to spin up new instances of your application and you will be sure that everything you need to run your application will be there, every time. When you take an image and creates a running instance of it you create what’s called a container. More about this later.

To be able to pull down an image and create a running container from it you first need to install Docker on your machine. Until recently Docker was only able to run on Linux, but thanks to Microsoft and Docker you now have both container and Docker support natively in Windows 10 (Pro/Enterprise) and Windows Server 2016. 

## The engine, the daemon and the client

Docker is built using a client-server architecture where you will communicate with the Docker daemon using the Docker client. This is done from the command prompt by providing the commands to execute. 

The Docker daemon will do all the heavy lifting when it comes to building images and deploying containers. 

The Docker daemon, its API and the client communicating with the daemon using its API, all belong to what’s called the Docker Engine. So when talking about Docker people often talk about the Docker Engine, which is the container runtime and the tooling to build and run your containers.

## A container is like virtual machines, right?

Containers is often compared with virtual machines, but that’s a bit like comparing apples and oranges. Both containers and virtual machines provides an isolated environment where your application can run. Containers, however, is both more lightweight and shares the kernel and other resources with the underlying OS on the Docker host. 

Docker compares virtual machines with houses and containers with apartments. A house has its own infrastructure and takes up a large area, even if you only use one room in your house. An apartment on the other hand shares the infrastructure with the rest of the building and comes in different shapes and sizes. Why buy a house when you only going to use a small part of it? 

So what does this mean in reality? For every virtual machine you create it will occupy space for an entire operating system plus all applications you need to install. On top of this it will need a lot of memory to run the operating system and all applications hosted in the virtual machine. A container will only allocate as much space and memory as it needs and the application hosted in the container will run as a process much like other processes on your computer. Another resource saving factor is that the content of the image is not replicated for every running container. Instead it will be reused among all containers that are based on the same image. 

## Images

As I mentioned in the beginning Docker enables you to package an application and its dependencies into an image. So what is an image?

An image consists of a number of read-only layers where each layer represents filesystem differences. Each of these layers has a unique ID, the content hash. An image and all of its layers will represent the root filesystem for a running container created from the image. Internally the image uses UnionFS and it’s up to the storage driver to take all these layers and providing a single unified view of it.

<img src="/images/Docker/Imagewithlayers.png" />

An image that has no parent is in Docker terms called a base image. The base image will include the userland for a Linux distribution or a Windows edition including system applications and libraries. 
This image will be the foundation that you can use to build all your other images upon. 

To build an image, you first need to create a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile contains instructions for how the image should be built. Every instruction will result in a new layer being created and added to the top of already existing layers. However, the layers from the image used as base isn’t copied to the new image. Instead it shares them with the new one.

<img src="/images/Docker/Imageusingbaseimage.png" />

If you want to create an image with IIS or MongoDB, you first create a Dockerfile and specify which image you will use as the base for your new image. You then add the appropriate instructions to install and/or setup the software. These instructions will run when executing the docker build command.

### Where to get images?

Images is retrieved/stored in something called a Registry. Docker hosts a registry called Docker Hub where you can pull down images to use, either directly or to build upon. On Docker Hub you will find both official images from e.g. Ubuntu or PostgreSQL and unofficial images provided by individuals. To search for images and/or create an account for storing your own images navigate your browser to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).

## Containers

As mentioned earlier a container is a running instance of an image with a thin read/write layer added on top of the image. This top layer is often referred to as the container layer. When the container adds a new file or make changes to existing files these changes are written to the container layer. Remember to not store important files inside of the container because you should be able to create and destroy a container whenever you need to. If you need to store data that should survive the container, then consider to use a volume instead. Reading and writing to a volume also bypasses the storage driver and is therefore faster.

<img src="/images/Docker/Container.png" />

Because the layers in the image are read-only, changes to these would not be possible. The read-only nature of the image also means that Docker can reuse the layers in an image between multiple running containers instead of making a copy of them for each container. This makes containers much more space efficient from virtual machines.

<img src="/images/Docker/Containerssharingimagelayers.png" />

As mentioned before the layers in the image will provide the root filesystem for the container and information about what process to start along with the container and other metadata. To describe a container in simple terms it’s a running isolated process. If this process for some reason stops, the container will stop running too.

The container will run on top of the kernel for the operating system on the Docker host. The process/processes running inside of the container will be seen by other processes outside of the container running on the same host. However, processes inside of the container will only see each other and not processes outside of the container. The container will also not have access to the hosts filesystem. Instead it will see the filesystem from the image, so for all processes inside of the container everything will look like a freshly installed OS. 

Beside process isolation the container also provides isolation of other resources like filesystem, network, registry and IPC to name a few of the isolation points. This ability to take a system resource and make it appear to the container that it has its own instance of it is called namespaces. 
The isolation of network also means that every container will have its own IP-address.

## Docker on Windows

From the beginning Docker was only available for Linux users, later available for Windows using Docker Toolbox or Docker for Windows. Since Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise Anniversary Edition and Windows Server 2016 these OS have built-in support for containers and can run Docker natively.

When running Docker on Windows we actually have support for two different types of containers, Windows Containers and Hyper-V Containers. The main difference between these two types of container is that a Hyper-V container will run inside a highly optimized VM instead of using the kernel from the host directly. Hyper-V Containers therefor brings an extra layer of isolation. Worth to mention is that you don’t need to do any changes to the Dockerfile or image to be able use Hyper-V Containers. Just specify that you want to run the container in Hyper-V isolation. 

If you’re a user of Windows 10 you will only be able to run Hyper-V Containers. Windows Server 2016, however, is able to run both types. 

### Installing Docker on Windows 10

This section will describe how to install container support and Docker on Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise Anniversary Edition. Before preceding please ensure that you have the required Windows 10 edition and that the build number is at least 14393.222. You can find the build number by running Winver.exe.

<img src="/images/Docker/winver.png" />

After you have ensured that you fulfill the requirements to run Docker on Windows 10 you can open up an elevated instance of Powershell.

Before downloading and installing Docker you need to install the Container and Hyper-V features, then restart your computer.

```
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName containers -All

Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All

Restart-Computer -Force
```

When the features are installed and the computer have restarted you can proceed with the installation of Docker. The following commands below will download and install Docker, add the installation path to the Path environment variable, register Docker as a service and also start Docker. All of these command should be executed using an elevated instance of Powershell. 

```
Invoke-WebRequest "https://get.docker.com/builds/Windows/x86_64/docker-1.13.1.zip" -OutFile "$env:TEMP\docker-1.13.1.zip" -UseBasicParsing

Expand-Archive -Path "$env:TEMP\docker-1.13.1.zip" -DestinationPath $env:ProgramFiles

$env:path += ";$env:ProgramFiles\Docker"

$existingMachinePath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path",[System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)

[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $existingMachinePath + ";$env:ProgramFiles\Docker", [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)

dockerd --register-service

Start-Service Docker
```

### Install Docker on Windows Server 2016

The installation of Docker on Windows Server 2016 differs a bit from installing it on Windows 10. However, we will still install the container feature and Docker using an elevated Powershell instance.
First of all, we need to install the container support and then restart the computer.

```
Install-WindowsFeature containers

Restart-Computer -Force
```

When your server has restarted, open a new elevated instance of Powershell and type in the commands below. This will download Docker, extract the archive to the installation folder, setup the Path environment variable and last, register Docker as a service and start it.

```
Invoke-WebRequest “https://download.docker.com/components/engine/windows-server/cs-1.12/docker-1.12.2.zip” -OutFile “$env:TEMP\docker.zip” -UseBasicParsing

Expand-Archive -Path “$env:TEMP\docker.zip” -DestinationPath $env:ProgramFiles

[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(“Path”, $env:Path + “;C:\Program Files\Docker”, [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)

dockerd.exe –register-service

Start-Service Docker
```

## Using the Docker CLI

This section will provide a brief overview of some of the commands available using the Docker client. For more information about available commands see the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/). 

### Pulling down an image

```
docker pull microsoft/nanoserver
```

### Create a container from an image

```
docker run microsoft/nanoserver
```

### List all containers

List all containers, even the stopped ones.

```
docker ps -a
```

### Stop a running container

Each container will get an ID and a name. If you not giving the container a name Docker will automatically generate one. Both the ID and the name will be shown when listing containers and can be used to stop a running container. If you using the ID keep in mind that you don’t need to enter the whole ID just as much that the container can be distinguished from the other existing containers.

```
docker stop sick_swartz
```

### Start a stopped container

```
docker start sick_swartz
```

### Remove a container

By default, a container need to be stopped before it can be removed. To stop the container and force it to be removed use the -f flag.

```
docker rm sick_swartz
```

### List all downloaded images

```
docker images
```

### Remove an images

```
docker rmi <image id>
```

### Print information about disk usage

```
docker system df
```

## So what’s next?
