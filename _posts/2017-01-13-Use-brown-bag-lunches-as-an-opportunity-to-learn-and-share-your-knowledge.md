title: Use brown bag lunches as an opportunity to learn and share your knowledge
---

At my employer we take advantage of what we call Lunch & Learns, mostly known as Brown bag lunches.
If you're not familiar with the concept, Brown bag lunches provides an opportunity for short informal employee education or training mostly performed during lunchtime. 

At my workplace we perform it like this. 

1. Select a subject you want to talk about.
2. Inform your colleagues about the subject you're gonna talk about and when and where this will be held. Most of the time this is perfomed at the kitchen at the office. 
3. Perform your presentation to your colleagues.

Doesn't sound too complex, right? Of course you have to pick a subject, but most of the time this is the easy part. What you have to remember is that you only have one hour for your presentation. It can sound like a huge amount of time, but if you have selected a topic you're really interested in this will only be enough to scratch the surface. 

However, Brown bag lunches is a great opportunity for both learning and sharing. Always wanted to learn that new framework? Tell your colleagues that you gonna hold a presentation about it. This will certainly motivate you to get started. Worked on a interesting problem for one of your customers? Share your experience about it. Tinkering with a hobby project on your spare time? Spread the word about it.

I'm planning to hold a couple of different presentation during this year. My first presentation will be about Docker and for each presentation I plan to write a blog post about the subject. This will be how I prepare for the presentation and at the same time share my knowledge to my readers.
