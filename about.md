My name is Johnny Hansson. I'm a developer from Sweden primarly focusing on back-end development using .NET and C#. I also enjoy front-end development and other languages beside C#. I try to stay open minded and select tools and languages based on context instead of religious beliefs. With that said even I have my opinions which makes me lean on agile practices like testing.

This blog will be about technology and ideas I find interesting and useful.

### More Information

I was born in the northern parts of Sweden, but now live in the southern area. Besides developer I'm also a hobby photographer and cyclist which finds it interesting to fiddle around with electronics from time to time.
